Features
========

* Create and edit product categories and products in SilverStripe SiteTree
* Versioning of prodcuts 
* Easily extendable with your own shipping and discount rules

Improvements
============

* Different paymentsystems (like creditcards, paypal...)
* Multilanguage (currently in german, but build for international use - but no translation, yet)

Install
=======

Copy folder into your SilverStripe folder and run as usual a /dev/build?flush (admin login required)

Requirements
============

None, except SilverStripe 2.4 or higher (should also run on 2.3, but not tested)

Attention
=========

I made this module for own purpose, so you have to take some time and take a look through the code to get in it and do some preferred changes for yourself.
